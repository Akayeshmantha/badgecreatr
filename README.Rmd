 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RMHogervorst/badgecreatr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RMHogervorst/badgecreatr)


# introduction
This package was inspired by the [badgerbadger](https://github.com/badges/badgerbadgerbadger) package that checks for badges of travis, code coverage open issues, dependencies and licenses.
It would be nice to have a simple function that adds these things to a readme.rmd file in R.


I would like to include the following badges /shields standard:

- [x] repo status <http://www.repostatus.org/>
- [x] travis shield
- code coverage
- licence 


Additionaly:
open issues, pending pull-requests, cran shield
