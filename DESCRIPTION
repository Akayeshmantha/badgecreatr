Authors@R: person("Roel M.", "Hogervorst", email ="hogervorst.rm@gmail.com", role = c("cre", "aut"))
Description: Tired of copy and pasting almost identical markdown for badges in
    every new r package that you create on github? 
    This package will search for relevant information
    such as a travis file, codecov and create the relevant badges in your 
    readme.rmd file. Currently creates badges for  projectstatus, licence
    travis build status, codecov, minimal dependent r version, cran, 
    current version of your package and last change.
