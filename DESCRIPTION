Authors@R: person("Roel M.", "Hogervorst", email ="hogervorst.rm@gmail.com", role = c("cre", "aut"))
Description: Tired of copy and pasting almost identical markdown for badges in
    every new r-project on github? This package will search for relevant information
    such as a travis file, codecov and create the relevant badges in your 
    readme.rmd file. Currently creates badges for  Codecov, last change, travis, 
    projectstatus and licence.
