introduction
============

This package was inspired by the [badgerbadger](https://github.com/badges/badgerbadgerbadger) package that checks for travis, code coverage open issues, dependencies and licenses. It would be nice to have a simple function that adds these things to a readme.rmd file in R.

I would like to include the following badges /shields standard:

-   repo status <http://www.repostatus.org/>
-   travis shield
-   code coverage
-   licence

Additionaly: open issues, pending pull-requests, cran shield
